##  Overview

The **ChainFusion-PoC** project addresses the challenge of cross-chain asset transfers between Ethereum and Aeternity. The main feature of the application is swapping Ethereum to Aeternity, accomplished by leveraging the [ae-bridge](https://ae-bridge.com/) and the [Superhero DEX](https://aepp.dex.superhero.com/) while automating the process. It features a user-friendly interface for bridging and swapping tokens, real-time price updates, and seamless wallet integration. Ideal for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and developers, this project enhances interoperability in decentralized finance, simplifying transactions across blockchain networks.

##  Getting Started

###  Prerequisites

Before getting started with chain-fusion-poc, ensure your runtime environment meets the following requirements:

- **Programming Language:** TypeScript
- **Package Manager:** Yarn
- **Container Runtime:** Docker

##  Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SKIP_ETH`: Skip the Ethereum-related bridge operations. This a development setting as transaction on the Ethereum Network can be expensive. If the flag is present with any value, the operations will be skipped.
- `AE_PRIVATE_KEY`: Private key for the Aeternity account used for paying for the dex swap transactions. This account should be funded with some AE. 1 AE is enough for around 1500 bridge & swap calls. It needs to be in hex format similar to `4d60aca4542c2...c3676a7c1ccf`. Use the [sdk](https://docs.aeternity.com/aepp-sdk-js/v13.3.3/quick-start/) to generate a new account.

### Configuration Variables

The project uses the following configuration variables, defined in the `src/constants/index.ts` file, to manage cross-chain operations and connections. These variables are predefined with sensible defaults and can be adjusted to suit your specific deployment requirements:

- **`ETH_MOCK_ADDRESS`**: The mock Ethereum token address used for testing purposes.
- **`ETH_BRIDGE_ADDRESS`**: The Ethereum bridge contract address for transferring assets to Aeternity.
- **`AE_BRIDGE_ADDRESS`**: The Aeternity bridge contract address for receiving bridged assets.
- **`AE_WAE_ADDRESS`**: The wrapped Aeternity token (WAE) contract address.
- **`AE_DEX_ROUTER_ADDRESS`**: The Superhero DEX router contract address for facilitating token swaps.
- **`AE_WETH_ADDRESS`**: The wrapped Ethereum token (WETH) contract address on Aeternity.
- **`ETH_NATIVE_ETH_PLACEHOLDER_ADDRESS`**: A placeholder address representing Ethereum‚Äôs native token; must be in lowercase.
- **`AE_WEB_SOCKET_URL`**: The WebSocket endpoint for Aeternity's middleware to listen for real-time updates.
- **`AE_NODE_URL`**: The URL for interacting with the Aeternity blockchain node.
- **`AE_NETWORK_ID`**: The identifier for the Aeternity network (e.g., `ae_mainnet`).
- **`AE_MIDDLEWARE_URL`**: The URL for Aeternity's middleware API to query blockchain data.

Ensure they are correctly configured in your environment before deploying the application.

## Development

There are a few scripts within the `/scripts` folder that can be used to help with development:

- `callDEX.js`: Swaps AE for tokens using the AE DEX; requires a mnemonic private key as the `MNEMONIC` environment variable.
- `deployTestnetBridge.js`: Deploys and configures bridge and token contracts on AE testnet; requires `MNEMONIC`.
- `fakeBridgeIn.js`: Simulates a bridge_in transaction on the AE testnet bridge contract; requires `MNEMONIC`.

In general there is no setup required for development, just run the application and start developing:

```sh
yarn dev
```
